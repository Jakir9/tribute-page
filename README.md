## Overview

I was given the opportunity to create a simple tribute page about anyone and I decided to choose to make it about Muhammad Ali the famouse boxer. Muhammed Ali was and inspration to many people all over the world inside and outside the ring. He stood up for social justice issues on the biggest political stages and was not afraid of standing up for his beliefs and other people.
